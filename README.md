Issue: Export to Excel not working in tool

Currently the export to excel functionality only works in the unpackaged python for this.


Clean Street Names:
This script needs to be imported to the toolbox, possibly should be further refined to highlight non-standard streetnames to user in a list and to deal with North East South West.

This was a test tool to make selections work, it can be deleted.
